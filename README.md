# NINJA-STUDIO
Created Home Screen Carousel using HTMl, CSS, JS.
Added favourite and recent played songs sections using JavaScript functions.
Added play/pause and next/previous functionality to the player section.
Ensured good code quality in terms of using classes, proper names for classes/variables.
Added proper comments to the files which improves the readability of code.
I have also used Font-awesome for icons and implemented some basic functionalities like play, pause, forward, previous, song-info change etc.

Also I have hosted my app on Netlify.
